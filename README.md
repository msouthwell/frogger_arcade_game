# FROGGER ARCADE GAME
===============================
## Gameplay
--------
The goal of the game is to move your character from the grass to the water
without touching any bugs.  Movement occurs via the arrow keys.

The game progesses in difficulty each time you reach the water.  Reach the water
enough times and a collectable item will spawn.  Collect the gem and move to the
water to complete the level.  The difficulty is reduced after each of the
five levels is completed.

Collecting items isn't required but you only have one chance to collect each.

Collect all five items and then keep going to see how high of a score you can get.
